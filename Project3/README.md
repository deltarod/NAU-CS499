# Stochastic gradient descent with early stopping regularization

This project is about implementation and usage of the stochastic gradient descent with early stopping regularization
 
## Algorithm Code
[The code for NNetOneSplit can be found here](https://github.com/deltarod/NAU-CS499/blob/af0ad765918756d8ee129ba0612e3874974a3485/Project3/StocGradDescent.R#L7)
 
## Requirements
R installed
Rstudio optional but recommended for running.

## Instructions
* Set working directory to the Projects Folder
* run MainRunner.R
